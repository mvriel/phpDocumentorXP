Welcome
=======

Welcome to the documentation for phpDocumentor.

With these tutorials, guides and references we try to provide you with all the information that you need to optimally
document your code and leverage phpDocumentor to generate an extensive set of documentation for your application.

The documentation is divided into several sections,

1. :doc:`getting-started/index`, which is a series of concise tutorials that will help you get running within minutes.
2. :doc:`internals/index`, care to contribute to phpDocumentor or interested in its architecture? Then this section
   is for you.

Documenting source code comes with quite a bit of lingo and specific terms; because it can be hard to remember them all
there is also a :doc:`glossary` that aims to explains all concepts. Throughout this documentation we continuously refer
to it, to help you comprehend everything that phpDocumentor has to offer.

What is phpDocumentor
---------------------

phpDocumentor is the de-facto API Documentation Generator for PHP since the year 2000.

phpDocumentor is a tool with which it is possible to generate documentation from a set of text files written in a Markup
language and an API Reference using your project's source code. With this documentation you can provide your consumers
with more information regarding the functionality embedded within your source and not only what is usable to them from
your user interface.

Goals
-----

The phpDocumentor project has the following goal:

    *"Provide PHP Developers with all the tools and resources necessary to write
    effective and comprehensive documentation with as little effort possible."*

It tries to achieve this goal by:

* Maintaining the `PHPDoc Standard`_ for describing source code meta-information using DocBlocks
* Providing the application `phpDocumentor`_ to

  * Generate API Documentation
  * Create reports on errors in your DocBlocks, deprecated elements and TODOs
  * Generate graphs to help understand how your project is coupled
  * Generate Reference Documentation
  * Generate User manuals

* Providing a comprehensive documentation regarding the PHPDoc Standard, how to effectively write your source
  documentation and how each of the applications work.
* Providing templates_ to change the look and feel of phpDocumentor.
* Enabling PHP Developers to extend the functionality and/or integrate these tools into your own application using
  plugins.
