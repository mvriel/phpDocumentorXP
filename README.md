phpDocumentor XP
================

> *Important*: This is an experiment and as such there is no guarantee that this will hit production

This is an Experimental (XP) version of phpDocumentor where I experiment with a completely new architecture and
support for new features.

The goal for phpDocumentor is to make documentation as simple as possible for your project and to enable you to create 
any type of documentation that you desire looking the way you want it to be.
 
With phpDocumentor 2 we hit the limit of that architecture in terms of complexity and how easy or not it is to add new
features such as the creation of Guides. In the past few years DDD is an emerging concept and with this implementation
we attempt to apply concepts from DDD to make it easier for people to recognize different parts and how these interact.
